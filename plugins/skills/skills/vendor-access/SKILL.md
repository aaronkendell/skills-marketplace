description: How to reach every third-party service in this workspace — Cloudflare, Fly, Sentry, Grafana, Langfuse, Resend, Neon, Infisical — from a session. Which CLI or API to use for each, the exact account and org identifiers, which Infisical path holds the credential, what permissions to scope a token to, and how to run every one of them headless in a cloud agent. Use whenever a task needs a vendor's data or a vendor's credential, or when creating or scoping a token.

# Reaching the vendors

Everything here runs from a shell with a token read from Infisical at call time.
There is no MCP connector for any of it — see "Why not MCP" at the end.

**Every command below must work headless.** Cloud agents have no browser and no
TTY: never run an interactive login (`wrangler login`, `fly auth login`,
`gh auth login`, `infisical login` without `--method`), never rely on a cached
session, and pass credentials by environment variable or flag.

## Getting any credential

The machine identity is the only thing that has to exist on the box. Never ask a
human to run `infisical login`; the CLI is always unauthenticated.

```bash
CFG=~/.config/bokendell/infisical.json
ACCT=bokendell   # golf | keepings | swarm | hive | portfolio | bokendell
read -r CID CSEC PID < <(python3 -c "
import json; a=json.load(open('$CFG'))['accounts']['$ACCT']
print(a['clientId'], a['clientSecret'], a['projectId'])")
TOKEN=$(infisical login --method=universal-auth --client-id="$CID" --client-secret="$CSEC" --plain --silent)

INFISICAL_TOKEN="$TOKEN" infisical secrets get <NAME> \
  --projectId="$PID" --path=<PATH> --env=production --plain --silent
```

`--projectId` is required outside a repo with `.infisical.json`. Environments are
`development` / `staging` / `production`. Never echo a secret into output, a
file, or a commit.

**`bokendell` is the account for anything workspace-level.** Product credentials
live in that product's own project.

## The map

Credentials live at **`/infrastructure/<vendor>`** in the Infisical project that
owns them, named for the vendor and nothing else. The project already namespaces
them, so there is no product prefix: `golf` `/infrastructure/fly` `FLY_ORG_TOKEN`
says everything.

| Vendor | Use | Secret name |
|---|---|---|
| **Cloudflare** | `wrangler` for Workers/KV/R2/D1, REST for the rest | `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` |
| **Fly** | `flyctl` | `FLY_ORG_TOKEN` |
| **Sentry** | **REST** — `sentry-cli` cannot query issues | `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `SENTRY_ORG` |
| **Grafana** | **REST** — no first-party query CLI | `GRAFANA_URL`, `GRAFANA_SA_TOKEN` (Viewer) |
| **Langfuse** | CLI or REST | `LANGFUSE_{BASE_URL,PUBLIC_KEY,SECRET_KEY}` |
| **Resend** | `resend-cli` | `RESEND_API_KEY` |
| **Neon** | `neonctl` | `NEON_API_KEY` |
| **GitHub** | `gh` | `GITHUB_TOKEN` from the environment |

Skills for most of these are installed from the vendors' own repos:
`cloudflare/skills`, `getsentry/skills`, `grafana/skills`, `langfuse/skills`,
`resend/resend-skills`. Prefer them over improvising against the API.

## Identifiers — read them from the repo

**Every repo carries its own `.claude/vendors.md`.** Read that file before doing
anything vendor-specific: it names which Fly org, Sentry org, Cloudflare account,
Grafana stack, Langfuse project and Resend account *that* repo uses, and which
Infisical project owns the credentials.

    cat .claude/vendors.md

Per-repo rather than one shared registry, because the answers genuinely differ —
golf is on the bagman Cloudflare account and the bagman Sentry org while hive,
portfolio and swarm share bokendell; hive, portfolio and swarm share one Grafana
stack while golf has its own; keepings has a Resend key that is empty in every
environment. A single table would be a list of exceptions.

It also puts the file where the work is: a repo's `.claude/` is present in every
worktree and every cloud agent checkout, which a workspace-root file is not.

If `.claude/vendors.md` is missing, say so rather than guessing an org slug — a
wrong one fails with a message that reads like a permissions problem.

## Scoping tokens

Mint the narrowest token for the job and let it expire. Defaults are dangerous:
Fly's read-only tokens default to **twenty years**, and Cloudflare's templates
grant far more than their names suggest.

```bash
fly tokens create readonly --org bagman-538 --name "<what for>" --expiry 8760h
fly tokens create deploy   -a  bagman-api   --name "<what for>" --expiry 720h
```

**Cloudflare: build a Custom token, never a template.** Account scope, Read only:
Workers Scripts, Workers KV Storage, Workers R2 Storage, Workers Observability,
Workers Tail, D1, Queues, Hyperdrive, AI Gateway, Account Analytics, Account
Settings. Zone scope, Read: Zone, DNS, Analytics.

Never grant a session token `Workers Scripts: Edit`, `DNS: Edit`,
`Access: Apps and Policies: Edit`, or `API Tokens: Edit`. Those run and protect
the infrastructure, and a token holding them can rewrite the thing holding it.

**Verify before trusting a token.** A `403` means denied; anything else means the
permission is present and only the payload was rejected:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" -X PUT \
  "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/workers/scripts/probe" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{}'
```

**Grafana:** use a **Viewer** service account, not Admin. An Admin service
account can assign RBAC roles, which is escalation from something meant to read
dashboards.

**Sentry:** `org:read` unless something genuinely has to write.

**Resend:** a sending-only key where the job only sends.

## Headless notes per tool

- **wrangler** — `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` in the
  environment. Never `wrangler login`. Add `--yes` to `deploy`; `secret put`
  reads the value from stdin, so pipe it rather than typing it.
- **flyctl** — `FLY_API_TOKEN`, or `-t <token>`. `fly apps destroy` and
  `fly deploy` both need `--yes`. `fly secrets set --stage` does nothing until a
  deploy; without `--stage` it restarts the machines itself.
- **gh** — `GITHUB_TOKEN` in the environment. No `gh auth login`.
- **infisical** — always `--method=universal-auth` with the machine identity.
- **resend-cli** — `RESEND_API_KEY` in the environment. See
  <https://resend.com/docs/cli-agents> for the agent-oriented usage.
- **sentry / grafana / langfuse** — plain `curl` with a bearer. Nothing
  interactive to avoid.

## Sending email

We send with **React Email** rendered through Resend. Use the
`resend/resend-skills` skills — `react-email` for the templates,
`resend` / `resend-cli` for delivery, `email-best-practices` for the rest.

## Why not MCP

A connector's tool schema is sent on **every request**, used or not: Resend is 99
tools and roughly 33k tokens, Langfuse 84 and 21k across three projects,
Cloudflare around 2,500 API endpoints. A skill costs nothing until it is called.

Four MCP integrations were attempted in this workspace and four failed in their
own way — a vendor gate above the stack, a wrapper that framed SSE wrongly and
isolated no sessions, an image that silently ignored its auth token, and an
undocumented per-stack authorization server. `curl` against the same vendors
worked first time, every time.

The one exception is `oura`, which has no CLI and no third-party API, and is
served from the gateway at `mcp.bokendell.com/oura`.
